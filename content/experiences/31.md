As JavaScript Teacher at HackYourFuture we teach fundamental of Programming by always being challenged by Language barrier and Learning Curves.

The School Program haims, and succeed, to make **Full-Stack Developer in six months**; during my class my students might be approaching coding for the first time. We cover all the basic aspects of programming by teaching Primitives and Core aspect or more advance topics like introductions to TDD and BDD.
We support them during the assignments and we do code reviews to make sure that they deliver good quality code.

In July 2017 trough **HYF** I had the opportunity to teach web development to 10 students selected by **United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees** in **UNHR office in Duhok - Iraq**.

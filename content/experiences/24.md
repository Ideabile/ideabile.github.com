<b>Ordine degli ingegneri</b> is an association of engineers in the province of Pistoia. We revamped its website using a <b>WordPress</b> base and customized it to get a <b>CMS</b> style. Inside the platform, I built a number of plugins. These included: <ul> <li><h2>Members synchronization</h2></li> <li><h2>Custom Profile Informations</h2> Each member has the possibility to decide which information to show, and even add extra information such as profile picture, personal CV, or tag him or herself with keywords.</li></ul>

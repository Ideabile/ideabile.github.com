I believe in open source, and I love to share my passion and work with the world whenever possible. This is why I have constructed several repositories with different projects. These can be found below: <ul><li><h2>Tire-Bouchon</h2>A PHP bootstrap framework with ORM integration and JS and View strategies. 



<a href='https://github.com/M3kH/tire-bouchon' target='_blank'>GitHub</a></li><li><h2>Socks Logger</h2>A NodeJS runtime sever that is an interface to allow logging of applications and manage logs. 



<a href='https://github.com/M3kH/socks-logger' target='_blank'>GitHub</a></li><li><h2>PHP Socks</h2>A PHP integration for the <b>Socks Logger</b>. 



<a href='https://github.com/M3kH/PHP-Socks' target='_blank'>GitHub</a></li></ul>

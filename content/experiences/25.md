When I joined the company I was originally tasked with developing Tasks and Bills management software, but over the course of the year we moved toward other projects for different business needs.

 My key projects included: <ul> <li>Task and Bill Basic Management System</li> <li>Booker for Educational Courses</li> <li>Software for autogeneration of PDF Certificates</li> </ul>

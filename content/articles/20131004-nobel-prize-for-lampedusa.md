# Nobel Prize for Lampedusa

![Nobel Prize](/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/nobel.png)

After reading [Why Lampedusa deserves the Nobel Prize](http://http://gatti.blogautore.espresso.repubblica.it/2013/10/04/why-lampedusa-deserves-the-nobel-prize/). Fabrizio Gatti was undercover when he experienced the Lampedusa culture. But this treatment wasn't reserve just to him. I was ten years old when in the restaurant of my parents came a friend of us to ask help for some just arrived tunisian people. Some of them where in bad conditions and some of them were already died. Ten minutes after Lampedusa's people formed different groups for different tasks: food, clothes, preparing locations, rescuing and burying the bodies. There wasn't a country, there was just Lampedusa's people. I don't know if Lampedusa needs a Nobel Prize, but I know that Lampedusa is a symbol for everybody.

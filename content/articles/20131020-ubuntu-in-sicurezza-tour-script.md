# Tour script for Lock your ubuntu

![Security Ubuntu](/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/fingerprint.png)

  Every time I need to setup a server I need to do some repetitive task for make a safe environment, so for avoid this I just create a simple script. So following this tutorial: [How to secure an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS server](http://www.thefanclub.co.za/how-to/how-secure-ubuntu-1204-lts-server-part-1-basics) If you want execute it: 
    
    
    wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/b5ykuxgsqcpt72k/sec.sh;bash sec.sh;rm sec.sh;

During the execution is required modify lot of file, so please use the tutorial reference on top to see how. Enjoy!

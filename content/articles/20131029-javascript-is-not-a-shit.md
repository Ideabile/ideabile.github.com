# JavaScript is not a shit

**But why you don't use it?**

I was creating a post for defending JavaScript, after reading [this](http://live.julik.nl/2013/05/javascript-is-shit); but I have lost my focus after reading some "conspiracy" comments written in the same article. The comments told_ _about Committers in JavaScript Standards, and they said are composted just by  _IT Leaders Companies; _... after that, I started to looking for the Author of JS: _[Brendan Eich](https://brendaneich.com/)_ How you can see he is not a Graphic Designer, but I think the web page is better then others _Programming Language Authors_ ( I would like to save the _top five_ for another post ). Brendan also has an own Word Press installation with his customizations. Actually my attention is not about the design of the page, but the absent of JavaScript! So please Brendan, if you are fan like we are for JS, please promoting it with using in your page too. I'm joking, maybe he could be too busy to do it, but actually I'm still surprise. Btw the answer: [For modern development, Javascript is just something you need to learn](http://sidekicksrc.com/post/for-modern-development-javascript-is-just-something-you-need-to-learn/)

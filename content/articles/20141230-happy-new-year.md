Hello There :-)! Maybe you are asking your self, "Why I'm here?" Or maybe  You don't! But really who cares. Apparently you are a special person to get this invitation; yes this is an invitation, I will say a '**Last Minute Invitation**'. Another year is gone, and indeed we don't want loose the change to do a party! So, if you loose all your weeks thinking what to do in _the last of the year_ but you are still like: ![The Big Lebowski - Couch](/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/giphy.gif) Maybe this can look has an opportunity to you :-) In short therm yes we want do a dinner with you!!! Address: Esmoreitstraat 9HS, Amsterdam We wait you until: 9 PM So are you in? If yes! Great! But still is not the end. We would like to make the dinner together with you! We would buy some drinks and do some food, but would be great if everybody bring something, maybe something which in your culture is important for this day. But don't worry if you can't bring something, what matter is your presence. So the plan is have a dinner in my house, with some music, some drinks and _**wait until the 00:00:00!!!**_ After that we would like to spend the begging of the day outside, maybe in a party, who knows. But for that and for coordinate the stuff we brings, please use the comments are bellow! And if you can't make it anyway **_We wish you the best year ever!_!!** Kiss and Hugs, Cristina, Marika, Massimiliano e Mauro.

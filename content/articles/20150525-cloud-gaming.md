Is not a mystery that after the [OnLive](http://onlive.com/) experience we would be able to use power hardware from warehouses and share it to any kind of device. To allow us to play without thinking to hardware requirements. 

Not only that, Cloud Computing can offer a new key change to the market of video games, and change radically their business models; and convert them as a service models, same that happen to the software.

From the beginning to the _'Insert Coin'_ to the era of _'free to play'_ the market can change again. And probably Game Publishers should consider to sell package Game + Cloud Computing + Streaming = Pay and Play where you want. So a bit like coming back to the retro Games Rooms.

_'Pay for Play'_. In the beginning I didn't understand why Chromebook was there in the market, looks a bit unrealistic. And more recently the new Mac Book come's in, which has sort of the same vision. But in a era where Cloud can handle the hardware requirements and transfer the complex rendering calculation, and send them has rendered stream, through internet. The device like RaspBerry PI ($25) can become a full console, whit-out having any hw requirements. I was thinking careful before buying any kind of console, or computer, just to satisfy my 2/3 hours weekly of gaming. Yes I'm not really a gamer. 

Honestly I don't like to pay up in front for something I would rarely use, so Hardware would be pointless because I spent most of the time in my computer and I don't need another one. Unfortunately long time ago I decide to invest my all hard gained budget in a Mac Book Pro. And even if it cost me so much I couldn't play any recent game with it.

Since didn't have a proper video card. So I spend some research if was possible to craft or buy an external Graphic Video Card, and come's out that was few people did it. 

But still you have to buy some Video card, some Power Adapters and Power Supply Units and some Port adapters to be able to connect to the Thunderbolt Port. 

Everything ends up around _250$_ which is less or more half then a console but still a consistent budget for a solution which I wasn't enthusiastic to invest since you can't run native in Mac OS. 

Then Larry Land come's out with an Article ([Run your own high-end cloud gaming service on EC2](http://lg.io/2015/04/12/run-your-own-high-end-cloud-gaming-service-on-ec2.html)) where he show and explain how to run the Steam In-House Streaming technology on Amazon EC2 instances, I decided to give it a try and to see if this experiments was worth it the money. The result is the video that you find in the begin (at the top).

_Steam In-Home streaming diagram technology._ I could setup and play with my cloud console for less then 2€, and pay the game for 19.99€ (Assassin Creed IV). So a total game + hw of 21€. My lucky is that Amazon Recently open a new Data Center at Frankfurt, and that allow me to have a good ping response time for the gaming experience. What you think about?

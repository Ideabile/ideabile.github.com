Especially when is something that I <em>truly believe</em>.</p>\n<p>It can happen that while I&#39;m confronting my self to an Idea, I will be sceptical about it.\nWhen I start to think at it, even if is my own one, I question it.</p>\n<p>Not sure if these question are valid for any kind of topics, but to get an idea:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>What are the trades? Gains vs Pays? Why is worth it?</li>\n  <li>Did someone else has experience with it? What does it say? ~ Googlit!</li>\n  <li>What are the requirements? What does cost maintaining?</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m against. Instead I&#39;m looking to convince my self to it.\nActually if I start questioning would be that somehow I already bought the idea and I&#39;m starting considering.</p>\n<p>I start this post with a quote from Confucius because I was inspired by my latest discussion that I&#39;ve with some other coders.\n<code>Semicolons or not?</code></p>\n<p>Now you might now that I&#39;m a JavaScript lover and try to get most of my skill and diets.\nI went from that fork before and I&#39;ve my investigations ready. It took me a while since I was a semicolons supporter to get into the diet of avoid them.</p>\n<p>Today has been an Year that I did that decision and all my pet projects reflect that choices.\nI&#39;m proud of it.</p>\n<p>Doesn&#39;t really matter is a good decision that I made or not. When the time pass by I would re-valuate it.\nThe only thing that I care is the approach in how I get there and what arguments power that choice.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Semicolons in JavaScript are optional and in some cases not needed at all.</em>\n  <em>Questioning if is needed put them or not while coding is just loosing time.</em>\n  <em>Plus modern transpiler add semicolons for you.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That was enough to buy me, the braid is basically pay to the fact that now days I always transpile my code.\nIs quiet a lot of config but indeed is not just a bunch of less-semicolons what I&#39;m gaining.</p>\n<p>Coming back to the quote, I like semicolons in the past, I&#39;m happy I leave them behind.\nI was the imbecile that look to the finger and the wise that look to the moon at the same time.</p>\n<p>Especially in these small details is hard to say if what your thoughts are driven by ideology or if there is an scientific-alike approach.\nInvestigate the limits of a thought especially if you&#39;ve an opinion is hard.</p>\n<p>The only thing that I hope isn&#39;t being the <em>imbecile</em> that looks to the details; but rather the <em>wise man</em> that look to the <em>wide picture</em>.</p>\n<p>So to the approach of yesterday after having a discussion that almost end up in taste arguments, I try to prove to me that the way I write code today is better than what it was yesterday.</p>\n<p>I end up doing this: <em>10 line sugar</em></p>\n<iframe height='265' scrolling='no' title='bgDisco' src='//codepen.io/M3kH/embed/XgKKmV/?height=265&theme-id=0&default-tab=result&embed-version=2' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/M3kH/pen/XgKKmV/'>bgDisco</a> by Mauro Mandracchia (<a href='https://codepen.io/M3kH'>@M3kH</a>) on <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.\n</iframe>\n<p><em>What you can do in 10 line of JS?</em></p>","file":"20170713-ideas-and-taste"}

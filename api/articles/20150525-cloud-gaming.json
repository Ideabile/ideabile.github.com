To allow us to play without thinking to hardware requirements. </p>\n<p>Not only that, Cloud Computing can offer a new key change to the market of video games, and change radically their business models; and convert them as a service models, same that happen to the software.</p>\n<p>From the beginning to the <em>&#39;Insert Coin&#39;</em> to the era of <em>&#39;free to play&#39;</em> the market can change again. And probably Game Publishers should consider to sell package Game + Cloud Computing + Streaming = Pay and Play where you want. So a bit like coming back to the retro Games Rooms.</p>\n<p><em>&#39;Pay for Play&#39;</em>. In the beginning I didn&#39;t understand why Chromebook was there in the market, looks a bit unrealistic. And more recently the new Mac Book come&#39;s in, which has sort of the same vision. But in a era where Cloud can handle the hardware requirements and transfer the complex rendering calculation, and send them has rendered stream, through internet. The device like RaspBerry PI ($25) can become a full console, whit-out having any hw requirements. I was thinking careful before buying any kind of console, or computer, just to satisfy my 2/3 hours weekly of gaming. Yes I&#39;m not really a gamer. </p>\n<p>Honestly I don&#39;t like to pay up in front for something I would rarely use, so Hardware would be pointless because I spent most of the time in my computer and I don&#39;t need another one. Unfortunately long time ago I decide to invest my all hard gained budget in a Mac Book Pro. And even if it cost me so much I couldn&#39;t play any recent game with it.</p>\n<p>Since didn&#39;t have a proper video card. So I spend some research if was possible to craft or buy an external Graphic Video Card, and come&#39;s out that was few people did it. </p>\n<p>But still you have to buy some Video card, some Power Adapters and Power Supply Units and some Port adapters to be able to connect to the Thunderbolt Port. </p>\n<p>Everything ends up around <em>250$</em> which is less or more half then a console but still a consistent budget for a solution which I wasn&#39;t enthusiastic to invest since you can&#39;t run native in Mac OS. </p>\n<p>Then Larry Land come&#39;s out with an Article (<a href=\"http://lg.io/2015/04/12/run-your-own-high-end-cloud-gaming-service-on-ec2.html\">Run your own high-end cloud gaming service on EC2</a>) where he show and explain how to run the Steam In-House Streaming technology on Amazon EC2 instances, I decided to give it a try and to see if this experiments was worth it the money. The result is the video that you find in the begin (at the top). </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/steamhardware/InHomeStreamingDiagram_t.jpg\" alt=\"Steam InHome Streaming\" /></p>\n<p><em>Steam In-Home streaming diagram technology.</em> I could setup and play with my cloud console for less then 2€, and pay the game for 19.99€ (Assassin Creed IV). So a total game + hw of 21€. My lucky is that Amazon Recently open a new Data Center at Frankfurt, and that allow me to have a good ping response time for the gaming experience. What you think about?</p>","file":"20150525-cloud-gaming"}

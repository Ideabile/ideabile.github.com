Fabrizio Gatti was undercover when he experienced the Lampedusa culture. But this treatment wasn&#39;t reserve just to him. I was ten years old when in the restaurant of my parents came a friend of us to ask help for some just arrived tunisian people. Some of them where in bad conditions and some of them were already died. Ten minutes after Lampedusa&#39;s people formed different groups for different tasks: food, clothes, preparing locations, rescuing and burying the bodies. There wasn&#39;t a country, there was just Lampedusa&#39;s people. I don&#39;t know if Lampedusa needs a Nobel Prize, but I know that Lampedusa is a symbol for everybody. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://temi.repubblica.it/espresso-appelli/nobel-to-lampedusa-sign-your-nomination/\">Nobel to Lampedusa, sign your nomination</a></p>","file":"20131004-nobel-prize-for-lampedusa"}

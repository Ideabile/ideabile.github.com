Easy to do: pay (<strong>95$</strong>), find a Volunteer want do the Supervisor, and <strong>Let&#39;s Go!</strong> I found <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=186717963&locale=it_IT&trk=tyah&trkInfo=tas%3Amassimiliano%2Cidx%3A1-1-1\">Massimiliano Scifo</a>, friend in the life, but also Developer, I share my screen with him and I run the test. There are 70 question to answer in 70 minute so 1 minute for question, I answer and my score was 90%, I only did one and I didn&#39;t try again. It&#39;s takes 44:00 minute to finish, in easy way, we laffing a lot on the easy question and spend some time on the most tricky or hardens, but really I just find few I cannot answer with the 100% safety. After that... 95$ for a digital certified where not even go to advanced topic, and not even provide a self-hosted image, I found a bit expensive. I still miss some Advanced Topics, like: </p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Performance Questions</li>\n<li>Unit Testing</li>\n<li>Name Spaces</li>\n<li>AMD or better ES6 in general</li>\n<li>Serve Side</li>\n<li>Ashicronous Techniques</li>\n<li>XSS Teqniques and Defence</li>\n<li>Optimizations and Compressions</li>\n<li>Continuos Integrations\nFinally they give me the possibility to share it (the image on top) with you! But they don&#39;t provide the hosted image for it! I think for 95$ for each test, would be enough for host and invest to a designer for do different kind of design of the icon, and why not even for add more advanced test. After that I&#39;m more proud to have finish to read, in this year: </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Learning-JavaScript-Design-Patterns-Osmani/dp/1449331815/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1383488246&sr=8-1&keywords=javascript+design+patterns\">Learning JavaScript Design Patterns </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596806752/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">JavaScript Patterns</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/059680279X/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">High Performance JavaScript (Build Faster Web Application Interfaces)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Maintainable-JavaScript-Nicholas-C-Zakas/dp/1449327680/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1383489012&sr=1-1&keywords=maintenable+javascript\">Maintainable JavaScript</a>\nand buy this: </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596805527/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">JavaScript: The Definitive Guide: Activate Your Web Pages (Definitive Guides)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470540710/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i03?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">Professional XMPP Programming with JavaScript and jQuery</a>\nI spent a little bit more but I think I get much more then just a Certificate. Do you suggest some other Certification Programs, where I can prove the Advanced Techniques?</li>\n</ul>","file":"20131103-english-w3schools-javascript-certificate"}

		Hi! I am Mauro! I'm a <b>programmer</b> / <b>designer</b> and I love to read <b>Bruno Munari</b> books just as much as I love to learn new <b>JavaScript</b> patterns.<br><br>

		My passion is to create things, and that isn't just with regards to visual or programming design - but even in my kitchen - <b>Creativity</b> has no limits!<br><br>

		I'm half <b>Italian</b> and half <b>Spanish</b>, and I lived the most of my life in the small island of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=lampedusa&amp;oq=lampedusa&amp;aqs=chrome..69i64j0l5.6893j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank"><b>Lampedusa</b></a>, just off the coast of <b>Sicily</b>.
		If you have not heard of this <b>Mediterranean paradise</b>, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=lampedusa&amp;oq=lampedusa&amp;aqs=chrome..69i64j0l5.6893j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank"><b>check it out</b></a>!<br><br>

		Out of my work the most interesting thing to me are people. I love to discover new cultures and meet amazing individuals, and talk with them about something, even about the weather :)
